<h2>Breakable Toy At Launch Academy</h2>

Micro-Jobs is a job hunt portal but with a difference.
My purpose of creating the website is to cater to the “small job” demands
that often crop up in the day to day routine. It may so happen that you being the owner
of a small restaurant suddenly find yourself short of workers for a shift,
an event or just for this coming weekend. Hiring completely new workers for the purpose
not only proves to be expensive and time consuming but also unnecessary after the crisis gets over.
It is in such a scenario that Micro Jobs plays a key role and provides the
employers with such part-time employees who would gladly do the job at much less 
payment than professional help.
